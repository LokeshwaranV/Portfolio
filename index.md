## Understanding Data Structures and Algorithms in Python using departmental store data set
## Description
The Departmental Store Automation project is a Python-based solution designed to streamline operations in departmental stores. As the Tech Lead for a software company, I developed this project to automate tasks such as billing, inventory management, and sales analysis for departmental stores like Walmart and Amazon Fresh.
<br>
The project includes features like: <br>

Dynamic item management: Add or remove items from the store directory. <br>
Automated billing system: Calculate total costs for customer transactions, including taxes. <br>
Inventory management: Track the frequency of items purchased and manage stock levels. <br>
Sales insights: Identify top-selling items and apply discounts based on sales data. <br>
