## Melanoma Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
### Description
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer, from skin images. Melanoma accounts for a significant portion of skin cancer deaths, highlighting the importance of early detection. The dataset consists of images of various skin diseases, including melanoma, obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

## Neural Machine Translation (NMT) Model Building
### Description
The Neural Machine Translation (NMT) project focuses on building an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model to translate Spanish sentences into English. This project is motivated by the need for a US-based life insurance company to communicate effectively with the Spanish-speaking community in Mexico. By developing an NMT model, the company aims to provide seamless communication and coverage to this community.

Data Cleaning: Special attention is given to data cleaning tasks specific to the Spanish language, including handling special characters, to ensure accurate translation.
Encoder-Decoder Architecture: The model is based on the encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes the input sentence in Spanish and the decoder generates the translated sentence in English.
Dataset: The project uses a paired corpus of English-Spanish data provided by Anki, ensuring a reliable dataset for training and evaluation.
Practical Application: The NMT model developed in this project has practical applications beyond the insurance industry, such as helping local traders do business with English-speaking merchants.
Educational Value: By working on this project, participants gain a deeper understanding of NMT models and attention mechanisms, enhancing their knowledge of natural language processing.
